Webbed is a very very simple search engine which I was able to build after going through a course named CS 101 on http://www.udacity.com website in which they have taught us to build a web crawler. In real they never implemented the search engine running on the web browser like what google.com and bing.com run like, but somehow using Beautiful Soup, I managed a to get working search enigne.

To build this search enigne, I have used Openshift as a platform to run the application on, Python as a Language, MySQL as the backend, Beautiful Soup as the HTML parser.

The web crawler script ufinel_crawler.py uses BeautifulSoup, an HTML parsing library by Leonard Richardson, and the Robot Exclusion Rules parser by Philip Semanchuk.
