Webbed is a very very simple web crawler cum search engine that will able to crawl websites in a very polite and controlled manner so that none of the ROBOTS.TXT gets hurts. 

=============================LIMITATIONS:========================
1: At this time, the search engine Webbed can only query single word.
2: The search linked does not have any description part.
3: Webbed is just able to search text strings.

Currently I am working to get the Webbed to look for multiple query with description for the searched links. 

A working version of this application is available here : www.webbed.co.cc.
